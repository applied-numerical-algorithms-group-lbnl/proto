# Developer Notes

## Ghost Cell Convension:
Several data holders require an argument "ghost" which is Array<Point, DIM+1>. The convension for this structure is that the
first element is the size of the ghost region for the actual BoxData elements stored in the data holder (e.g. the "bulk" ghost region)
and the other elements (indexed 1, 2, ..., DIM) are the sizes of the extra data holders allocated on block boundaries for
boundaries BETWEEN PATCHES of the indexed codimension. 

## Miscellaneous:

BlockIndex: Typedef'd in MBGraph.H. It's just an int, but calling a reference to a block a BlockIndex makes code easier to understand
