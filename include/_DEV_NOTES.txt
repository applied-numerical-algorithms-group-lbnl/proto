# Library Convensions:

## Function Signatures
Arguments to functions in header files dont have any prefix (e.g. a_). Arguments to functions in the corresponding cpp files
may use whatever form is convenient for the developer. The purpose of this is to improve readability in modern
text editors which have syntax completion.

Prefer slightly more verbose function names than terse ones if the latter would be ambiguous.
For example, what is the "size" of an MBDisjointBoxLayout? Number of blocks? Number of patches? Instead of a generic "size" function, define the following:

int numBlocks() const;
int numPatches() const;

## Printing

Small objects (Point, Box, etc) should have the following I/O methods:
std::string str() const;                                        // creates a std::string representation of the object
void print(std::ostream& stream = std::cout) const;             // prints the output of this->str() to the specified ostream, defaulting to std::cout. Adds an endline.
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& stream, const Obj& obj); // prints the object into an ostream
