This is a simple example that uses a Godunov advection to do simple advection.
The advection velocity is a vortex centered in the mdidle of the domain.  There are perodic domains.
The scalar is set to zero everywhere except for a blob that moves around the center.  The blob starts on the 
x axis.

usage:  Godunov.ex  -n nx -c cfl -t tmax -m maxstep -b blobrad -d domain_size -l blobloc

nx:             number of cells in the x direciton
cfl:            The cfl number the simulation runs at.
tmax:           Maximum time of the simulation.
maxstep:        Maximum number of time steps in the simulation.
blobrad:        Radius of the advected blob.
domain_size:    Real size of the domain.
blobloc:        location on the x axis where the blob is centered.
