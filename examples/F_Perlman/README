This is the code for Perlman's first test case, a smoothly decaying vorticity field. Main includes deposition of the particles and the time loop.

In SRK4 in exec, the particle velocity and RHS for RK4 is determined as part of the class F. The errors in vorticity and velocity are also calculated here.
Interp houses the interpolation functions, both W44 & W22.  W## interpolates from the particles to the grid and W##p interpolates from grid to the 
particles. The distinction is so appropriate data types are returned.

Deformation contains the function where the RHS of the deformation evolutation equation is determined.  In getVelocity, the velocity gradients are calculated.
The QR function calculates the QR decomposition using Gram Schmidt. The maximum eigenvalue of R and angle of Q are recorded.
