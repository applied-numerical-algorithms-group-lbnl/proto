This is the code for Perlman's first test case, a smoothly decaying vorticity field. Main includes deposition of the particles and the time loop. 
In SRK4 in exec, the particle velocity and RHS for RK4 is determined. Interp houses the interpolation functions and deformation contains the deformation matrix.
