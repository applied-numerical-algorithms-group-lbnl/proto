4th Order Finite Volume Euler Solver

Usage:
    boxSize = size of solution box not including ghost cells
    maxLev = number of levels of refinement. 
           = 1 -> Simple solve
           = 3 -> Execute convergence test
    time = time to which integration will be carried out
           suggested value: ~0.1.
           
By default, code will output a .vtk file for each iteration for visualization.
