4th Order Finite Volume Euler Solver

Suggested stopping time = .1.

If convTest = false, does a single grid run with imput Grid size size1D.
If convTest = true, performs a Richardson error run at fixed time step  
for grid sizes size1D, 2*size1D, 4 size1D, for maxStep = input, 2*input, 4*input.
in the latter case, only the final solutions, errors in density are output to .vtk fines, and
the max norm of the errors themselves order of accuracy output to cout.
