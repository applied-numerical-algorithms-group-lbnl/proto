Stuff that I think we can clean up.
(1) I don't think implicit functions need a factory.  They can just be
handed around.
(2) We can just ask the implicit function if it knows about
inside/outside issues to see if a box is all regular/covered.
(3) IndexTM (and its bastard stepchild GenericArithmetic) should
probably go away but they are used pretty heavily in the bowels of the
geometry generation.
