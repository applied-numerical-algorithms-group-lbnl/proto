\begin{itemize}
\item I am leaving copy out of irregdata.   The device-based one
  should only be used in the context of data over a box which should
  only be accessed via aggstencil.   THe host based one is just being
  used to store moments temporarily and copy should not be necessary.

\item I am also taking out the IVS based interface as it has a
  different semantic  based upon whether something is cell based or
  face based.
