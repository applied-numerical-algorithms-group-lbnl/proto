\begin{itemize}
\item I am leaving copy out of irregdata.   The device-based one
  should only be used in the context of data over a box which should
  only be accessed via aggstencil.   THe host based one is just being
  used to store moments temporarily and copy should not be necessary.

\item I am also taking out the IVS based interface as it has a
  different semantic  based upon whether something is cell based or
  face based.

\item For now, boundary conditions at the domain will be handle via
  stencils at each domain face.

\item Some stuff that was stored in layoutdatas or leveldatas can be
  stored in vectors because we do not need to do copying between them
  any longer (EBGraph for example).

\item The domain boundary condition interface needs more work.    For
  multiple ghost cells, we would need multiple stencils

\item variables in stencils have not been properly thought out.  Until
  we get to tensor operators, maybe this does not matter. 
\end{itemize}
